# WolfBase

This project is a personal playground for learning and experimenting with data synchronization in PWA. It's a tool I built for my own use, not as a polished open-source project or a model for best practices.
Just a bit of coding fun; feel free to explore!

## What's this all about?

This project is primarily:
- A learning exercise 📚
- A tool for (my own) personal use 🛠️
- An experiment in data synchronization between PWA / IndexedDb and server 🧪

## What it's ==not== about:

- A polished, open-source project 🚫
- A model for best practices or architecture 📐
- A definitive guide on how things should be done 🧭

This is just me having fun with code—take it for what it is!
